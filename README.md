# News-Android-Mobile-Project

This project was the mobile application of a news site with four main activities. These activities
are; the first is the category of news, the second is the details of the news, the third is the
comments of the news, and finally the activity of posting comments. I used android studio and
java language in this project. I also bought the contents of the activities via a web service.
